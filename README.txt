With git init you can track any and all changes within a file. 
Git can track any addition or deletions. Every time you make a 
change you must include git add and git commit with every 
change.

Also, you can track changes from any program so long that the 
file is in a plain text format. If it the file is not in a 
plain txt format, it will be difficult for Git to track the 
changes properly but it will note there were changes.
